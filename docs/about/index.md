    至于我的名字“Tendourisu”，来自于游戏“碧蓝档案”中的[天童爱丽丝](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/zh-hans/%E5%A4%A9%E7%AB%A5%E7%88%B1%E4%B8%BD%E4%B8%9D)]的罗马音“Tendou Arisu”，~~但github上的名字已经被占用了，于是我删掉了一个A~~。拥有/创造一个形如爱丽丝一样的人形机器人是我的梦想。以及本站的icon也来自于al1s与kei（~~没错这里也有yuri~~）的光环的渐变融合。

    Hello! TendouRisu has appeared! 🥳

    I am an undergraduate student majoring in Automation at THU (~~although my skills are still basic, I will work hard!~~). Currently, I am interested in reinforcement learning, embodied intelligence, and large models. I like to record my learning experiences and thoughts. If you are interested, you can check out my [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/TendouRisu), where you might find some helpful content. 😊

    In my free time, I like to
    - Listen to music (mainly JPOP and Vocaloid, ~~[weekly rankings](https://space.bilibili.com/12446725) are a must-watch every week~~) 👍
    - Watch anime (both new and old series) 📺
    - Read manga (I am a heavy Yuri fan and pay attention to illustrations and manga related to Yuri. Of course, you are also welcome to recommend some to me!) 😋

    As for my name "Tendourisu," it comes from the game "Blue Archive" character [Tendou Arisu](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/zh-hans/%E5%A4%A9%E7%AB%A5%E7%88%B1%E4%B8%BD%E4%B8%9D)'s romaji "Tendou Arisu," ~~but the name was already taken on GitHub, so I removed an 'A'~~. Owning/creating a humanoid robot like Arisu is my dream. The icon of this site also comes from the gradient fusion of the halos of al1s and kei (~~yes, there is also Yuri here~~).
